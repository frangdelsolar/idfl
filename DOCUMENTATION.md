## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:frangdelsolar/idfl.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd idfl
    ```

3. Run setup and project:

    a. With docker:

    ```bash
    make docker
    ```

    b. Without docker (needs `wkhtmltopdf` installed):

    ```bash
    make local
    ```

4. Automatic Setup will perform the following tasks:
    - Docker container with all dependencies
    - Database migrations applied
    - Three user roles created
    - Sample data imported from Excel files
    - Dummy test data generated
5. Access the admin at: `http://localhost:8000/admin`
6. Use these credentials to login:

    - Superuser: `admin`/`admin`
    - Customer Service: `cservice`/`cservice`
    - Reviewer: `reviewer`/`reviewer`

    ]
  }'
```

#### 📚 API Documentation

-   [JSON Schema](http://localhost:8000/api/schema/)

## 📝 Notes & Limitations

### Current Constraints

-   **Data validation** improvements needed for Excel imports
-   **User-company associations** not fully enforced in all views
-   **Basic async processing** using threading (upgradable to Celery)
-   **Logging** there's much more logging than needed. It's just for demo purposes.

### Technical Debt

-   **Type hints** - Limited type annotations in code
-   **Test coverage** - No test coverage
-   **Error handling** - Some edge cases need better coverage
-   **Database** - Maybe move to PostgresQL for better performance

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

This was a genuinely engaging project to work on - building a complete certification platform from scratch presented interesting architectural challenges and allowed me to design a robust system with real-world applicability.

I want to acknowledge that much of the code was created with AI assistance, which served as an incredibly productive pair-programming partner. However, I actively supervised every single line of code - reviewing, testing, and refining the output - just as I would when leading a development team in a professional environment.

The scope of implementing all five tasks (including optional API and background processing features) within a reasonable timeframe would have been significantly more challenging without this tool. It allowed me to focus on system architecture, user experience, and business logic rather than getting bogged down in boilerplate code.

The end result is a fully functional, well-documented application that demonstrates comprehensive understanding of Django, REST APIs, and enterprise workflow design - exactly what was requested in the exercise.
