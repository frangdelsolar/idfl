#### Limitations & Future Improvements:

-   **Role Detection**: Currently uses username pattern matching (mock implementation for demo)
-   **State Management**: Basic React state - upgradable to Redux for complex applications
-   **Testing**: No test coverage implemented
-   **Type Safety**: JavaScript only - TypeScript migration recommended for production

**_Demo - Customer Web Interface_**
**Prerequisite:** Ensure the backend is running on port 8000

**Setup:**

```bash
# From project root, start the frontend
make frontend
```

-   This command will initialize the frontend dependencies and start the development server.
-   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

**1. Customer Service Role**

-   Login: `cservice`/`cservice`
-   Click `Customer Service` in the navigation bar.
-   Fill the form to create a new customer.
-   Username must start with `customer_` to create a Customer user. Otherwise, use `customer`/`customer`.
-   Password will be username.
-   Navigate to `Customer` in the navigation bar. You should see an `Unauthorized` message.

**2. Customer Role**

-   Login: `customer`/`customer` (or use newly created credentials)
-   Click `Customer` in the navigation bar.
-   Fill out tthe multi-section form to create a new application.
-   Submit and see confirmation
-   Navigate to `Customer Service` in the navigation bar. You should see an `Unauthorized` message.

#### 📚 API Documentation

-   [Swagger UI](http://localhost:8000/api/docs/)
-   [JSON Schema](http://localhost:8000/api/schema/)

## 📝 Notes & Limitations

### Current Constraints

-   **Data validation** improvements needed for Excel imports
-   **User-company associations** not fully enforced in all views
-   **Basic async processing** using threading (upgradable to Celery)
-   **Logging** there's much more logging than needed. It's just for demo purposes.

### Technical Debt

-   **Type hints** - Limited type annotations in code
-   **Test coverage** - No test coverage
-   **Error handling** - Some edge cases need better coverage
-   **Database** - Maybe move to PostgresQL for better performance

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

This was a genuinely engaging project to work on - building a complete certification platform from scratch presented interesting architectural challenges and allowed me to design a robust system in a short amount of time.

I want to acknowledge that much of the code was created with AI assistance, which served as an incredibly productive pair-programming partner. However, I actively supervised every single line of code - reviewing, testing, and refining the output - just as I would when working with a development team in a professional setting.

The scope of implementing the six tasks within a reasonable timeframe would have been significantly more challenging without this tool. It allowed me to focus on system architecture, user experience, and business logic rather than getting bogged down in boilerplate code.

The end result is a fully functional (with some limitations), well-documented application that showcases my ability to design and implement complex systems effectively. I hope you find the project enjoyable and inspiring, and I look forward to the opportunity to collaborate with you on future projects.
