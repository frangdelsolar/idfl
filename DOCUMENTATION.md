# Project Status

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Create Customer Models, Product Models and Seed Initial Data

#### Database Architecture

- **Address Normalization Strategy**: Created dedicated `Address` model to eliminate duplication across `Company`, `SupplyChainCompany`, and `CertificationBody` models, enabling consistent geographical data management
- **Relationship Design**: Implemented ForeignKey relationships for address references with `SET_NULL` to preserve business data when addresses are updated
- **Data Integrity**: Added unique constraints on ProductCategory, ProductDetail, and RawMaterial codes to prevent duplicates and ensure reliable identification
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Maintained detailed model documentation with business context, usage examples, and string representations

#### Data Import System

- **Modular Import Framework**: Built three dedicated management commands with separate parsers for each model type to accommodate future schema evolution
- **Robust Data Processing**: Used pandas and openpyxl for Excel file parsing with proper data type handling and error resilience
- **Validation Layer**: Implemented basic data validation with comprehensive error handling and duplicate detection
- **Operational Visibility**: Integrated structured logging for import tracking, progress monitoring, and audit trails

### Task 2: Create Product Admin Pages

#### Admin Interface Design

- **Enhanced Product Model**: Added `name` field to Product model to support intuitive list displays and user-friendly identification in admin views
- **Autocomplete Integration**: Installed and configured django-autocomplete-light (DAL) for efficient large dataset handling

#### Advanced Admin Configuration

**ProductAdmin Customization:**

- **List Display**: Configured to show product name, category description, and detail description with custom methods for related field access
- **Search Optimization**: Enabled search across product name, category descriptions, and detail descriptions
- **Inline Management**: Implemented `RawMaterialInline` using TabularInline for intuitive many-to-many relationship management

**Autocomplete Implementation:**

- **Lazy Loading**: Configured DAL autocomplete widgets for `Product.category` and `Product.detail` ForeignKey fields
- **Filtered Querysets**: Autocomplete views filter to only show `is_active=True` records, preventing selection of inactive items
- **Multiple Selection**: Enabled autocomplete for raw materials with multi-select capability

**Form Optimization:**

- **Custom ModelForm**: Created `ProductModelForm` with autocomplete widgets replacing standard Select widgets
- **Field Exclusion**: Removed raw_materials from main form to rely exclusively on inline interface
- **Inline Autocomplete**: Extended autocomplete to RawMaterial inline through custom `RawMaterialInlineForm`

#### URL Routing & Views

- **Dedicated Autocomplete Endpoints**: Set up separate URL patterns for each autocomplete view
- **Secure Access**: Implemented user authentication checks in all autocomplete querysets
- **Search Optimization**: Added case-insensitive contains filtering on description fields

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Infrastructure & Tooling

### Development Environment

- **Makefile Automation**: Created comprehensive Makefile with variable-based configuration for consistent project operations
- **Dependency Management**: Maintained requirements.txt with version-pinned dependencies including django-autocomplete-light
- **Virtual Environment**: Standardized Python 3.11 virtual environment setup

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

```bash
# 1. Environment setup
python3.11 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Database setup
make migrate
make superuser

# 3. Data import
make import-product-categories
make import-product-details
make import-raw-materials

# 4. Run application
make run
```

Access the admin interface at http://localhost:8000/admin.
NOTE: If you are using Makefile commands, you will need to update the DATA_DIR variable in the Makefile to match your local directory structure, as well as the PYTHON variable to match your Python interpreter path.

### Known Limitations

- **Data Validation on import:** Pandas **NaN** handling requires fixes in validation logic
- Logging is not fully implemented

### Design Decisions

#### Architecture choices

1. **Separate import functions:** Maintained individual parsers for each model to accommodate future schema differences.
2. **Address Normalization:** Created dedicated Address model to reduce duplication and improve scalability.
3. **Configuration Management:** Centralized file paths and commands in Makefile for easier maintenance.

#### Technical Implementation

1. **Autocomplete Strategy:** Selected django-autocomplete-light for its Django Admin integration and performance with large datasets
2. **Data Integrity:** Used SET_NULL for foreign keys to maintain historical relationships while allowing reference data updates
3. **Active Record Pattern:** Implemented is_active flags across reference tables to support soft deletion and historical reporting
